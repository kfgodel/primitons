NAry
==============

A small Java project that represent the concept of 0, 1, or n elements  
  
You will usually use a nary to represents a search result, an object whose type could be used as one optional element,
 or many.
 
A Nary object is the join of Optional and Stream.  
Due to code limitations, Optional cannot be extended so we use a copy replacement (which is extender but not compatible with java.util.Optional)
